### About me
This is Yikai Zhang. I'm a statistical Ph.D. candidate with 10+ years of experience in statistics and machine learning:
- Developed innovative algorithms, including the Finite Smoothing Algorithm and Generalized Takeuchi’s Information Criteria, transforming SVM and large_margin classifiers.
- Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Fortran, delivering high-performance tools and **open-source packages**; integrate **Fortran/CUDA** kernels.
- Published author with research showcased at **ICML**.
- Successfully collaborated across diverse industries, including insurance and chemical manufacturing, to deliver impactful tools.
  
I will use this blog to update my packages' tutorials. 

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, R, CUDA C/C++, Fortran, SQL
- **ML**: PyTorch, scikit‑learn, XGBoost
- **Systems**: HPC, GitHub Actions, packaging (PyPI/R‑pkg)

### Work Experience

**Data Science Intern** — UFG Insurance _(Summer 2024)_  
- Refitted a bodily injury (BI) cost model in commercial auto (CA) insurance using XGBoost; leveraged large language models (LLMs) to extract, validate, and interpret multi-source data, improving prediction  accuracy by 15% and significantly enhancing model robustness.  
- Built a Python Shiny tool integrating SQL and LLMs to estimate insurable replacement value.
- Automated fraud detection from police reports with an LLM-based backend which significantly boosts claim flagging efficiency.  

**Data Science Intern** — Dow Inc. _(Summer 2023)_  
- Developed a DOE simulation app (R + Shiny) that improved design efficiency by 50% and computation speed by 35%. 
- Enhanced usability for statisticians and engineers, achieving 90%+ user satisfaction. 

**Graduate Researcher** — University of Iowa _(2019–Present)_  
- Research on **large-scale kernel SVMs**, **kernel logistics regression**, GPU acceleration, and insurance risk modeling.  
- Built open-source packages (**TorchSVM, hdsvm, SAFE, GTIC**) in PyTorch and R.  
- Integrated Fortran/CUDA kernels for high-performance computing.
